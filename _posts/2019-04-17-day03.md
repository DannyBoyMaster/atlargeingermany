<content:encoded><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Gerald, 1942</strong></h2><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The next night they continued SE across country, crossed the Fulda River on a small road bridge and reached the autobahn SE of KASSEL. After travelling 3 or 4 miles down the autobahn Williams’ feet gave out completely and it was decided to stop (0200 hrs), shelter being found nearby in a Dutch barn which was full of hay, and a very good rest was taken here the following day, during which several Germans came into the barn.</h2><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Danny, 2019</strong></h1><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I can somewhat relate to Gez (our family name for Gerald) here. Already, much of my upper right foot is either peeling away or blister-covered, and like them, I’ve had to call today’s march short. I had hoped to cover an ambitious 38km, but I confess that the physicality of this walk – exacerbated by the weight of my pack which, at a little over 15kg, is frankly too much – has taken me by surprise. Already, I’m beginning to see their effort as a feat of endurance comparable to, or perhaps even beyond, that of a modern-day elite ultra-distance athlete. When you consider all the factors stacked against them - incessant cold, bouts of shivering, lack of food and sleep, not to mention the psychological impact of being “on the run” – the mind simply boggles.</h1></content:encoded>
