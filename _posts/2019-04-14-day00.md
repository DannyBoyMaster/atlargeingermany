title: "Day 0: Berlin to Warburg"
---
<h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My last act of preparation for this trip was to run a half marathon. Feeling my body slowing at the 19km-mark, I imagined an invisible rope connecting me to a runner in the distance. I tried to feel it physically - a knot around my waist, an inexorable pull. It worked. I didn’t lose sight of the runner in the green shirt, and the final two kilometers were among my fastest of the race.</h1><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I begin this adventure, I feel connected to Gerald and Hugh in a similar way. Part of the challenge I’ve set for myself is to keep up with their pace - to get from Warburg to Wildberg in 17 days. It won’t take me through the most beautiful part of the world. Most of the walk will be on concrete, in one of the most industrialized areas in Europe. But this isn’t about landscapes and sightseeing. I’m drawn here because of Gerald and Hugh, and I’m hoping that they’ll be happy to pull me along with them.</h1>
