<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;<h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Gerald, 1942</strong></h2><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">FRANKFURT was reached on the tenth night out and the autobahn bridge over the Main River was crossed at approximately midnight during a very convenient air-raid. No sentries or guards were seen. The autobahn appeared to pass through the outskirts of the city (on the W. side) but they were practically clear of the builtup area when the all-clear sounded.</h2><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Danny, 2019</strong></h1><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Above a field of bright yellow&nbsp;<em>Rapsöl&nbsp;</em>in bloom, the sharp spike of Frankfurt’s&nbsp;<em>Europaturm </em>tower appeared: alien, Oz-like, blue with distance. This was the first sign of substantial change to the landscape of the past 9 days, and it felt like a marker of intent. Power pylons and wind turbines were no longer abstract objects on the horizon, but objects to be navigated through and around. It took hours to arrive in Frankfurt. I had the sense that the country was resisting the city’s encroachment; horses wandered asphalt streets, tractors shared bike lanes with commuting cyclists.</h1><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tomorrow, I will cross the River Main and begin the last half of the journey.</h1>]]></content:encoded>
