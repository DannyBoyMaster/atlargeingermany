title: General Observations

<content:encoded><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Gerald, 1942</strong></h2><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Daylight found them in very open country, no cover having been found, and the nearest wood or cover of any kind appeared to be about 10 miles away. The whole day was spent underneath a small tree which had just come into leaf, situated on the strip in the centre of the autobahn, and just below a road bridge which crossed above. During the day several pedestrians crossing the bridge stopped and looked directly down on to the tree and the traffic on the Autobahn was passing within a few feet of it.</h2><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Danny, 2019</strong></h1><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am utterly rinsed and can only muster two observations today:</h1><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1: Germany’s Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region, through which I have been walking for the last three days, is one of Germany’s “driving economic forces” (wikipedia). A good place to live? Most probably. But a densely populated industralised economic region for a multi-day walk? Probably wouldn’t have been my first choice.</h1><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2: On a long walk, you can wash shirts, underwear and socks as often as you like, but you can’t wash your pack until you’ve finished using it.</h1></content:encoded>
